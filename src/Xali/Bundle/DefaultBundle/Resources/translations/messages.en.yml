        <h2 class="text-center">What is Xali ?</h2>
        <br />
        In contries where there are wars, thousands of families are separated
        each years. Children lost their parents, and it's very difficult for
        organisations to get them together.<br />
        Xali is a free and open source project witch has for goal to get together
        lot of families who lives in these countries. We stay in our country, but
        NGO, organisations, come into these countries in order to help population,
        we must help them in their task.<br />
        This is why Xali is free and open source, every one can fork or use or
        participate to Xali, Xali has to help organisations.
        <br /><br />
        <h2 class="text-center">Why create Xali ?</h2>
        <br />
        One day in a programming competition, a challenge was to imagine a Web
        platform witch should help organisation to get together families. If
        this challenge was proposed it's because there is a real need of this
        kind of platform. So, in order to help organisations, help families
        witch are separated, we had to create Xali.<br />
        It will take a long time until Xali be functional and useful, but with
        hard work and motivation Xali will help thousands of people.
        <br /><br />

        There are several ways to contribute to Xali, no need to be a
        developper.<br />
