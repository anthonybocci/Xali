<p>In contries where there are wars, thousands of families are separated each years. Children lost their parents, and it's very difficult for organisations to get together them.
Xali is a free and open source project which has for goal to get together lot of families who lives in these countries.</p>

<p>We stay in our country, but NGO, organisations, come into these countries in order to help population, we must help them in their task.
This is why Xali is free and open source, every one can fork, use or participate to Xali, Xali has to help organisations.</p>

<a id="why-create-xali-" class="anchor" href="#why-create-xali-" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why create Xali ?</h2>

<p>One day in a programming competition, a challenge was to imagine a Web platform which should help organisation to get together families. If this challenge was proposed, it's because there is a real need of this kind of platform. So, in order to help organisations, help families which are separated, we had to create Xali.
It will take a long time until Xali be functional and useful, but with hard work and motivation Xali will help thousands of people.</p>
